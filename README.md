==========

This is the code of my submission for the Google Cloud Developer Challenge 2013.
Still pretty fresh out of high school, I wanted to change something about the fact
that some friends and I lacked a proper tool to manage our tests and assignments
together.

Although I didn't win the contest it was a really great experience to create this.
I was able to put the things I learned in the udacity courses [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101)
and [Web Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253) into practice.
